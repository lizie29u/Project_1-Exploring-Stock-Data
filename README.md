### <u>Summary</u>

* Black Swan Events disrupt different sectors of the economy in different ways. The financial sector took a big hit this year, retail stayed the same; E-commerce grew significantly.

* Can Monte Carlo Simulations foresee black swan events? 

As per our findings, Monte Carlo simulations are pretty accurate. Due to COVID-19, the RBC stock fell below the 5th percentile range projected by the Monte Carlo simulation, but quickly recovered.

* What was the best strategy for investors who had money in the market during the crisis? 

Long-term investors using the buy & hold strategy can wait out the crisis. The market seems to have already recovered since the initial slump in Mar/Apr.

* If an investor is looking to enter the market, are there any buy/sell signals, they should be aware of?

Using a new financial library called Backtrader, we have found that investors can use the small moving averages cross-over strategy, to gauge a good time to buy/sell. When the shorter-term MA crosses above the longer-term MA, it's a buy signal, as it indicates that the trend is shifting up. This is known as a "golden cross." Meanwhile, when the shorter-term MA crosses below the longer-term MA, it's a sell signal, as it indicates that the trend is shifting down. This is known as a "dead/death cross."

For example, below is the graph for the SPY index. You can see there is a buy signal around April 1st, 2020 and a sell signal coming up in the near future.
